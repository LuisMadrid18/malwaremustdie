# radare2 for servers support in 2020 (attention: r2jp community)

## Background

I would like to add radare2 compatibility test results so far and summarize the for UNIX server version that does not support 2020. The range for tests is for version 3.9.0 to the 4.4.0 and now in progress of 4.5.0.

The background is. We had a meeting with pancake on December 2019 (@SECCON 2019) in Tokyo and discussed what kind of support system could be committed this year (2020).

The conclusion is as follows. (The contents are for the inside of R2JP)
