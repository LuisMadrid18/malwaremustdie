## About us

In order to accomplish a better stand in reducing malware activity in the internet, a bunch of security researchers from various nationalities and cultures met and gathered in the internet, they have started a [MalwareMustDie initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MalwareMustDie), is then also known as "MMD". It is a non-profit group launched from Aug 28, 2012 started from a [small twitter community](https://twitter.com/MalwareMustDie), with the purpose [to raise malware awareness](https://www.google.com/search?q=malwaremustdie&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=nws) supporting our main purpose.

For they who want to help by supporting or volunteering, this movement is a one of many available options. We gather to contribute our skills from whatever we are good at, to oppose all forms of malware's activity, by helping verticals and horizontals to support the handling of their malicious infection, damage on incidents and propagation.

As a group of engineers, we have started from what we can, by contributing our malware analysis and our reports; were posted in ["Malware Must Die!" Blog](http://blog2.malwaremustdie.org/oldwww/) to then moved to own domain [malwaremustdie.org](http://blog2.malwaremustdie.org/oldwww/) and then moved again to better secure analysis posting platform in [blog.malwaremustdie.org](https://blog.malwaremustdie.org) when the team and projects gets a bit bigger; to reveal more of malware threat information from our collective analysis effort, in purpose to be hopefully can be legally processed further by related affected services or authority.
