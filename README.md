## About us

In order to accomplish a better stand in reducing malware activity in the internet, a bunch of security researchers from various nationalities and cultures met and gathered in the internet, they have started [MalwareMustDie movement](https://twitter.com/MalwareMustDie), is known also as "MMD". It was a pure movement initiated from Aug 28, 2012, with the purpose to raise malware awareness.

For them who want to help, support or volunteer, this movement is a one available option. We can gather to contribute our skills from whatever we are good at, on opposing malware's growth, by helping all verticals and horozntals to support the handling of malicious infection, damage and further infection propagation.

As a group of engineers, we were starting by contributing our malware report and analysis reports posted in ["Malware Must Die!" Blog](http://malwaremustdie.blogspot.com/), to then moved officially into our own domain in http://blog.malwaremustdie.org, to reveal the threat information along with its evidence for awareness in our collective effort, in purpose to be legally processed the further handling by related authority.
