# MalwareMustDie shared codes repository

## About us

In order to accomplish a better stand in reducing malware activity in the internet, a bunch of security researchers from various nationalities and cultures met and gathered in the internet, they have started a [MalwareMustDie initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MalwareMustDie), is then also known as "MMD". It is a non-profit group launched from Aug 28, 2012 started from a [small twitter community](https://twitter.com/MalwareMustDie), with the purpose to raise malware awareness.

For them who want to help, support or volunteer, this movement is a one available options. We gather to contribute our skills from whatever we are good at, to opposing malware's activity, by helping all verticals and horizontals to support the handling of malicious infection, damage on incidents and propagation.

As a group of engineers, we have started from contributing our malware analysis and our reports are posted in ["Malware Must Die!" Blog](http://malwaremustdie.blogspot.com/), to then moved into own domain in blog.malwaremustdie.org[https://blog.malwaremustdie.org], when the team is a bit bigger, to reveal more of malware threat information from our collective effort, in purpose to be hopefully can be legally processed further by related authority.
